## How To Play
1. Clone the repository to a folder of your choice.
2. Open the folder in the IDE of your choice.
3. Run `GameManager` to start the game. 
4. Use the up arrow key to launch the player upwards. Release the up arrow key to let the player fall back down. 
5. Rockets will launch at you - use the arrow keys to avoid them. The longer you survive the higher your score becomes!

## Tips
- The player's speed will get incrementally faster the longer you survive, so get ready to dodge fast!
- Collect hearts to accumulate extra lives. You lose a life if you hit a rocket. The game is over if you hit a rocket with zero hearts left. 
- Collect coins to increase your high score. 
- You can check out the high scores on the `Leaderboard` tab on the main menu when you start the game. 
- Press 'P' to pause/unpause the game. Pressing 'P' will also bring up the option to restart the game if you would like.
